### Introduction ###
####################

Basicly a Kartina.tv Player that comes with an OSD like you would expect it on a set-top-box.

Main goal of the project is to provide a nice interface for a HTPC.

Based on PyQt4?, Python3 & Python VLC Bindings

Should work on Linux, Mac & Windows (currently only tested on Linux, shutdown dialog only works in linux so far, watching TV should work anywhere)

current features:

- browsing & playing channels
- browsing & playing archive
- seeking
currently NOT supported:

- browsing & playing VOD
- favorites
- settings
- other languages besides german (but there are only few dialogs that are in german and not in russian like the shutdown dialog)
- streaming options, like buffersize etc.
- changing hotkeys
- recording
- and anyhing else you could think of, this is strictly for a testing purpose at the moment

### Configuration ###
#####################

1) Edit Kartina.py's last line to enter your Kartina.tv login
2) Look at the Keybindings in OSD.py, they're named and designed after standard remote keys

I'll explain further details as soon this will be anywhere near stable.
