#######################################

Basicly a Kartina.tv Player that comes with an OSD like you would expect it on a set-top-box.

Main goal of the project is to provide a nice interface for a HTPC.

Based on PyQt4?, Python3 & Python VLC Bindings

Should work on Linux, Mac & Windows (currently only tested on Linux, shutdown dialog only works in linux so far, watching TV should work anywhere)

current features:

 - browsing & playing channels
 - browsing & playing archive
 - seeking

currently NOT supported:

 - browsing & playing VOD
 - favorites
 - settings
 - other languages besides german (but there are only few dialogs that are in german and not in russian like the shutdown dialog)
 - streaming options, like buffersize etc.
 - changing hotkeys
 - recording
 - and anyhing else you could think of, this is strictly for a testing purpose at the moment

### Configuration ###
#####################

(1) setting login:
    Edit Kartina.py's last line to enter your Kartina.tv login (by default it is set to a test account, 141:141, which won't always work)
    interface = API('USERID', 'PASSWORD')

(2) Look at the Keybindings in OSD.py, they're named and designed after standard remote keys
    Those are the default ones:
    
    Up/Down/Left/Right:       Arrow-Keys
    OK: Return
    Red: F5
    Green: F6
    Toggle Fullscreen: F
    Toggle Letterbox: F10
    Seek 1 Min Forward: J
    Seek 10 Min Forward: L
    Seek 1 Min Backward: H
    Seek 10 Min Backward: K
    Play/Pause: P
    Stop: S
    Close/Shutdown: X
    
Well, it works. At least for me. Feel free to try it, but don't blame me if something happens.
This is BETA software.
